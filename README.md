Frontend - MiddleEnd - BackEnd

- We need an intermediate layer between client side and the microservices

- Using this middle end , when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which microservice should actaully respond to this request 

- We can do message validation ,response transformation , rate limiting 

- We try to prepare an API Gateway that acts as this middle end.
